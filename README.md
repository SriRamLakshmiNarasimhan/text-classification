# text-classifier

Using logistic regression, this text classifier predicts intent based on training.
The entire program is written in Octave and is in development.


To do:
1) Modify input to CSV format
2) Provision for separate training data and test data
3) Calculate Theta in different ways
  a) gradient descend with regularization
  b) gradient descend with in-built cost functions
  c) neural network (back propogation)
  d) support vector machine
 4) Loosely couple data extraction part and computation part
